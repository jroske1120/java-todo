## Todo App with React/Spring
This repo is from a Udemy course I completed that uses a React front end, a Java Spring Boot back end, and an H2 Database. There is also styling from Bootstrap.

## Why did I make this App?
This was a bit of an undertaking. Although proficient with JS and React, I am new to Java, SB, and H2. Additionally, this course uses a different IDE for the back end, Eclipse. So new things I learned included a new back end language, new database connections, as well as some manually implemented security features, much of it all in a new editor.

I want to become more proficient coding in Java. I'm comfortable using JavaScript and React, but want to be more adaptable and knowledgeable across languages, frameworks, databases, and editors.

Looking forward to learning more!
